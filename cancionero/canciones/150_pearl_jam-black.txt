This is taken from the first live acoustic version. 
I just corrected the lyrics and changed the chords a bit, to make it sound better. 
At least, I think so.

E7, Asus2, E7, Asus2, E7, A, E7, E7   

E7              Asus2             E7             Asus2
Sheets of empty canvas, untouched sheets of clay
     E7                A              E
Were laid spread out before me as her body once did
E7          Asus2          E7              Asus2
All five horizons revolved around her soul as the earth to the sun
E7            A                       E
Now the air I tasted and breathed has taken a turn

C                                    Em
Hmmmm, and all I taught her was everything
C                                  Em
Hmmmm, I know she gave me all that she wore

           D
And now my bitter hands,
      C
Chafe beneath clouds
            Em
Of what was everything
        D
Oh, the pictures
              C
Have all been washed in black
               Em
Tattooed everything

E7       Asus2               E7              Asus2
I take a walk outside I'm surrounded by some kids at play
    E7               A            E
Oh, I can feel their laughter so, why do I sear

C                                               Em
Hmmmm, and twisted thoughts that spin 'round my head, I'm spinning, oh
  C                                       Em
I'm spinning, How quick the sun can drop away

           D
And now my bitter hands
       C
Cradle broken glass
                Em
Of what was everything
        D
All the pictures have
         C
All been washed in black
             Em
Tattooed everything
        D
All the love gone bad
          C
Turned my world to black
                 D 
And tattooed all I see,
         C
All that I am,
         Em
All I'll be

D C     Em      D       C
  Yeah  Uh huh  Uh huh

  Em
I know someday you'll have a beautiful life,
  D                         C
I know you'll be a sun in somebody elses sky
    Em        D            C
But why, why, why can't it be,
C                 Em     D      C
Why can't it be mine

Em, D, C (ad lib till end)
