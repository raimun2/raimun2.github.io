Here's a little song I wrote
C#m
You might want to sing it note for note
         E        B
Don't worry, be happy.
    B
In every life we have some trouble
    C#m
But when you worry you make it double
         E        B
Don't worry, be happy.
   E	         B
Don't worry, be happy now.

CHORUS:

B  C#m       E         B     
   Don't worry, be happy. Don't worry, be happy.

B  C#m       E         B     
   Don't worry, be happy. Don't worry, be happy.
  

2nd VERSE:
B
Ain't got no place to lay your head
C#m
Somebody came and took your bed
       E         B
Don't worry, be happy.
B
The landlord say your rent is late
C#m
He may have to litigate
        E         B
Don't worry, be happy.

Look at me -- I'm happy.

Here I give you my phone number. When you worry, call me,
I make you happy.

3rd VERSE:

Ain't got no cash, ain't got no style

Ain't got no gal to make you smile
         E        B

B
'Cause when you worry your face will frown
  C#m
And that will bring everybody down
        E         B
Don't worry, be happy.

Don't worry, be happy now.
