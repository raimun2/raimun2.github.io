MA MA MA MA MA MA.. 
A
I, I can't get these memories out of my mind 
                 D                      A
And some kind of madness has started to evolve 
A
I, I tried so hard to let you go 
                 D                        A
But some kind of madness is swallowing me whole, yeah 
F#m    E       D
I have finally seen the light 
F'm        E       D                 A
And I have finally realised what you mean 
A
And now I need to know is this real love 
              D                  A
Or is it just madness keeping us afloat? 
A 
And when I look back at all the crazy fights we've had 
                       D                  A
It's like some kind of madness was taking control, yeah 
F#m            E       D
And now I have finally seen the light  
F#m        E       D
And I have finally realised what you need 
F#m            E       D
And now I have finally seen the end 
F#m         E         D
And I'm not expecting you to care, no 
F#m        E       D
And I have finally seen the light 
F#m        E       D
And I have finally realised 
          F#m   E   D
I need to love 
          F#m   E   D
I need to love 
F#m                   E
Come to me, just in a dream 
            D
Come on and rescue me 
      F#m           E
Yes I know I can be wrong 
              D
Maybe I'm too headstrong 

Our love is... 
A
MA-MA-MA-MA-MA 
A
MADNESS
