These AREN'T the chords that AIC uses in the actual studio recording, but these are the 
implied chords of the song. I use these in an acoustic version out at the bars. Enjoy!

Half-step down tuning (Eb, Ab, Db, Gb, Bb, Eb)

----Intro----

Em, D, A, Em
La-la-lala... etc

----Verse----

Em      D          Em
I'm the man in the box
Em     D     A
Buried in my shit

Em    G   D    A   Em
Won't you come and save me, save me

----Chorus---

Em     G     D     A
Feed...   my eyes, can you sew them shut?
Em     G   D         A
Jesus...   Christ, deny your maker
Em   G      D      A
He...   who tries, will be wasted
Em   G      D     A
Feed...  my eyes, now you've sewn them shut
